# File Loading Example

This example shows how you can make a simple static blog site using `.txt` files.

To run this example, compile `file-loader.cpp` along with the CTML library, and then run the executable.

Once you run it, it should ask you for a directory, just point to the `docs/` directory in the `file_loader/` folder.
